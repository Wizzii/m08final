# Basic Pizza Ordering System
Final for M08

RIP hopes and dreams of making images work.
Pillow did not like working with me.


--- HOW TO USE ---
1. Run file to open main window.
2. Use buttons on the main window to choose which pizza you'd like to order.
3. Use 'order and quit' to add it to your order
4. The main window will stay open, so you can exit whenever you feel like or continue using the program
